#Deck of Cards

##Approach
I started off figuring out what tests i needed for both deck and card. Once I finally figured out how to actually write the tests, I started defining my classes. I am a little rusty on my Ruby so this took a while and a lot of help from the Brook, Marco, and Kayla. Once all my tests passed, I did a little refactoring and tried adding a few more tests.
